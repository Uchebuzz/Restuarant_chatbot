# Multimodal LLM Project: AI-Powered Food Pricing and Visualization Chatbot  

## Project Overview  
This project involves creating a multimodal LLM (Large Language Model) application with Python that serves as an interactive, AI-powered chatbot. Designed for a client in the food industry, this chatbot integrates language processing, price retrieval, and AI-based food visualization to enhance customer engagement and service.  

## Key Features  
1. **Dynamic Price Retrieval:**  
   The chatbot can access and provide price details for various food items as instructed by the client. These prices are retrieved in real-time based on predefined datasets or API calls.  

2. **AI-Based Food Visualization:**  
   Leveraging AI visualization tools, the chatbot can generate visual representations of the food items requested by users. This feature enhances the interaction, providing a more immersive and engaging experience.
